#### TL;DR

I am a PhD candidate in Statistics, advised by [Prof. Gaynanova (UMich BioSTAT)](https://irinagain.github.io/), [Prof. Qian (TAMU ECE)](http://xqian37.github.io/), and [Prof. Carroll (TAMU STAT)](https://carroll.stat.tamu.edu/). My research centers on developing computationally tractable **personalized probabilistic models for statistical inference and prediction**. The primary motivation for my research has been **biomedical (wearables) data**. 

During PhD, I have interned at **Amazon** as an Applied Scientist, working with Richard Chen and Cheng Ji. My projects have focused on developing (1) a **multi-task deep learning** models for detecting system abuse and fraud, and (2) a **probability calibration** method for imbalanced datasets. 

This summer, I am interning at **Meta** as a Machine Learning Engineer, working with Litao Hu. My project focuses on exploring ways to extend **context length for large language models (LLM)**.
